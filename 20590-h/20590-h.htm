<h3>NOTE</h3>

  <p>This book is intended for those who have felt the need of a varied
  collection of alphabets of standard forms, arranged for convenient
  use.</p>

  <p>The alphabets illustrated, while primarily intended to exhibit the
  letter shapes, have in most cases been so arranged as to show also how
  the letters compose into words, except in those instances where they are
  intended to be used only as initials. The application of classic and
  medieval letters to modern usages has been, as far as possible, suggested
  by showing modern designs in which similar forms are employed.</p>

  <p>In view of the practical aim of this treatise it has been deemed
  advisable to include a larger number of illustrative examples rather than
  to devote space to the historical evolution of the letter forms.</p>

  <p>To the artists, American and European, who have so kindly furnished
  him with drawings of their characteristic letters&mdash;and without whose
  cordial assistance this book would hardly have been possible&mdash;to the
  master-printers who have allowed him to show types specially designed for
  them, and to the publishers who have given him permission to borrow from
  their books and magazines, the author wishes to express his sincere
  obligations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h2>ROMAN CAPITALS</h2>

  <p>In speaking of the "Roman" letter throughout this chapter its capital
  form&mdash;the form in monumental use among the Romans&mdash;will always
  be implied. The small or "minuscule" letters, which present nomenclature
  includes under the general title of "Roman" letters, and which will be
  considered in the following chapter, were of later formation than the
  capitals; and indeed only attained their definitive and modern form after
  the invention of printing from movable types.</p>

  <p>The first point to be observed in regard to the general form of the
  Roman capital is its characteristic squareness. Although the letter as
  used to-day varies somewhat in proportions from its classic prototype,
  its skeleton is still based on the square.</p>

  <p>Next to this typical squareness of outline, the observer should note
  that the Roman letter is composed of thick and thin lines. At first sight
  it may seem that no systematic rules determine which of these lines
  should be thick and which thin; but closer investigation will discover
  that the alternate widths of line were evolved quite methodically, and
  that they exactly fulfil the functions of making the letters both more
  legible and more decorative. Arbitrary rearrangements of these thick and
  thin lines, differing from the arrangement of them in the classic
  examples, have, <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>[2]</span> indeed, been often attempted; but such
  rearrangements have never resulted in improvement, and, except in
  eccentric lettering, have fallen into complete disuse.</p>

  <p>The original thickening and thinning of the lines of the classic Roman
  capitals was partly due to the imitation in stone inscriptions of the
  letter forms as they were written on parchment with the pen. The early
  Latin scribes held their stiff-nibbed reed pens almost directly upright
  and at right angles to the writing surface, so that a down stroke from
  left to right and slanted at an angle of about forty-five degrees would
  bring the nib across the surface broadwise, resulting in the widest line
  possible to the pen. On the other hand, a stroke drawn at right angles to
  this, the pen being still held upright, would be made with the thin edge
  of the nib, and would result in the narrowest possible line. From this
  method of handling the pen the variations of line width in the standard
  Roman forms arose; and we may therefore deduce three logical rules, based
  upon pen use, which will determine the proper distribution of the thick
  and thin lines:</p>

  <p><span class="scac">I</span>, Never accent horizontal lines. <span
  class="scac">II</span>, Always accent the sloping down strokes which run
  from left to right, including the so-called "swash" lines, or flying
  tails, of <span class="scac">Q</span> and <span class="scac">R</span>;
  but never weight those which, contrariwise, slope up from left to right,
  with a single exception in the case of the letter <span
  class="scac">Z</span>, in which, if rule <span class="scac">I</span> be
  followed, the sloping line (in this case made with a down stroke) will be
  the only one possible to accent. <span class="scac">III</span>, Always
  accent the directly perpendicular lines, except in the <span
  class="scac">N</span>, where these lines seem originally to have been
  made with an up stroke of the pen; and the first line of the <span
  class="scac">M</span>, where the perpendiculars originally sloped in
  towards the top of the letter (see 2). On the round letters <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span> the accents
  should occur at the sides of the circle, as virtually provided in rule
  <span class="scac">III</span>, or on the upper right and lower left
  quarters (see <a href="#Fig1">1</a>-<a href="#Fig2">2</a>), where in
  pen-drawn letters the accent of the down sloping stroke would naturally
  occur, as virtually determined in rule <span class="scac">II</span>.</p>

  <p>The "serif"&mdash;a cross-stroke or tick&mdash;finishes the free ends
  of all lines used in making a Roman capital. The value of the serif in
  stone-cut letters seems obvious. To define the end of a free line a sharp
  cut was made across it with the chisel, and as the chisel was usually
  wider than the thin line this cut extended beyond it. Serifs were added
  to the ends of the thick lines either for the sake of uniformity, or may
  have been suggested by the chisel-marked guide lines themselves. Indeed
  in late stone-cut Roman work the scratched guide lines along the top and
  bottom of each line of the inscription are distinctly marked and merge
  into the serifs, which extend farther than in earlier examples. The serif
  was adopted in pen letters probably from the same reasons that caused it
  to be added to the stone-cut letters, namely, that it definitely finished
  the free lines and enhanced the general squareness and finish of the
  letter's aspect.</p>

  <p>An excellent model for constructing the Roman capitals in a standard
  form will be found in the beautiful adaptation by Mr. A. R. Ross, <a
  href="#Fig1">1</a> and <a href="#Fig2">2</a>, from an alphabet of
  capitals drawn by Sebastian Serlio, an Italian architect, engraver and
  painter of the sixteenth century, who devised some of the most refined
  variants of the classic Roman letter. Serlio's original forms, which are
  shown in <a href="#Fig39">39</a> and <a href="#Fig40">40</a>, were
  intended for pen or printed use; but in altering Serlio's scheme of
  proportions it will be observed that Mr. Ross <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span> has partially adapted the
  letter for use in stone, and has further varied it in details, notably in
  serif treatment. In most modern stone-cut letters, however, the thin
  strokes would be made even wider than in this example, as in <a
  href="#Fig14">14</a>. Mr. Ross's adaptation shows excellently how far the
  classic letters do or do not fill out the theoretical square.</p>

  <p>Width proportions, which may be found useful in laying out lettering
  for lines of a given length, are shown in 3 in a more modern style of the
  Roman capital. In the classic Roman letter the cross-bar is usually in
  the exact center of the letter height, but in <a href="#Fig3">3</a> the
  center line has been used as the bottom of the cross-bar in <span
  class="scac">B, E, H, P,</span> and <span class="scac">R</span>, and as
  the top of the cross-bar in <span class="scac">A</span>; and in letters
  like <span class="scac">K, Y</span> and <span class="scac">X</span> the
  "waist lines," as the meeting points of the sloping lines are sometimes
  called, have been slightly raised to obtain a more pleasant effect.</p>

  <p>The Roman alphabet, although the one most in use, is unfortunately the
  most difficult to compose into words artistically, as the spacing between
  the letters plays a great share in the result. The effect of even color
  over a whole panel is obtained by keeping as nearly as possible the same
  area of white between each letter and its neighbor; but the shape of this
  area will be determined in every case by the letters which happen to be
  juxtaposed. Individual letters may, however, be widened or condensed to
  help fill an awkward "hole" in a line of lettering;&mdash;the lower lobe
  of the <span class="scac">B</span> may be extended, the center bar of the
  <span class="scac">E</span> pulled out (in which case the <span
  class="scac">F</span> should be made to correspond), the lower slant
  stroke of the <span class="scac">K</span> may be used as a swash tail,
  and the <span class="scac">R</span> may have its tail extended or drawn
  closely back against the upright line, and so on. Indeed, each and <!--
  Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span> every
  letter of the alphabet is susceptible to such similar modifications in
  shape as may make it best suit the space left for it by its neighbors.
  Observe, for example, the spacing of the word <span
  class="scac">MERITAE</span> in <a href="#Fig34">34</a>, and notice how
  the tail of the <span class="scac">R</span> is lengthened to hold off the
  <span class="scac">I</span> because the <span class="scac">T</span> on
  the other side is perforce held away by its top. In the page of capitals,
  <a href="#Fig124">124</a>, by Mr. Bridwell, see also how the different
  spacing of the word <span class="scac">FRENCH</span> in the first and
  second lines is managed. In the advertisement, <a href="#Fig123">123</a>,
  also by Mr. Bridwell, note how the letters are spaced close or wide in
  order to produce a definite effect. The whole problem of spacing is,
  however, one of such subtle interrelation and composition, that it can
  only be satisfactorily solved by the artistic sense of the designer. Any
  rules which might be here formulated would prove more often a drawback
  than a help.</p>

  <p>Certain optical illusions of some of the Roman letter forms should be
  briefly mentioned. These illusions are caused by the failure of certain
  letters to impinge squarely with determining serifs against the demarking
  top and bottom guide lines. The round letters <span class="scac">C, G,
  O</span> and <span class="scac">Q</span> often seem to be shorter and
  smaller than the other characters in a word unless the outsides of their
  curves run both above and below the guide lines. For the same reason
  <span class="scac">S</span> should be sometimes slightly increased in
  height, though in this case the narrowness of the letter makes less
  increase necessary; and <span class="scac">J</span>, on account of its
  kern, is governed by the same conditions as <span class="scac">S</span>,
  save when letters with distinct serifs come closely against it at the
  bottom. Theoretically the right side of <span class="scac">D</span> would
  require similar treatment, but actually this is seldom found necessary.
  The pointed ends of <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>[9]</span> the letters <span class="scac">V</span> and
  <span class="scac">W</span> should, for similar optical reasons, be
  extended slightly below the bottom guide lines, the amount of this
  extension being determined by the letters on each side of them. In the
  <span class="scac">A</span>, the Roman letterer at first got over the
  optical difficulty caused by its pointed top by running this letter also
  higher than its neighbors; but he later solved the problem by shaping its
  apex as shown in <span class="scac">I</span>, thus apparently getting the
  letter into line with its companions while still obtaining a sufficient
  width of top to satisfy the eye. Because of its narrowness, <span
  class="scac">I</span> should generally be allowed more proportionate
  white space on either side of it than the wider letters.</p>

  <p>Some idea of the proportionate variations required to counteract the
  optical illusions of the letters above named may be obtained from the
  practice of type-founders. In making the designs for a fount of type, it
  has been customary to first draw each letter at a very large size. Taking
  an arbitrary height of twelve inches as a standard, the points of <span
  class="scac">A</span> and <span class="scac">V</span> were made to extend
  about three-quarters of an inch above or below the guides, the letter
  <span class="scac">O</span> was run over about half an inch at both top
  and bottom, and the points of the w were made to project about the same
  distance. In pen lettering, however, it is possible and preferable to
  adapt each letter more perfectly to its individual surroundings by
  judgment of the eye than to rely upon any hard and fast rules.</p>

  <p>Certain variations between the stone-cut forms of the Roman letters
  and their forms as drawn or printed should be understood before an
  intelligent adaptation of stone forms to drawn forms, or the opposite, is
  possible. When drawn or printed a character is seen in black against a
  <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span>
  white ground with no illusory alterations of its line widths caused by
  varying shadows. In stone-cut letters, on the other hand, where the
  shadows rather than the outlines themselves reveal the forms, different
  limitations govern the problem. The thin lines of a letter to be <span
  class="scac">V</span>-sunk should generally be made slightly thicker in
  proportion to the wide lines than is the case with the pen-drawn letter,
  especially as the section is likely to be less deeply and sharply cut
  nowadays than in the ancient examples, for the workmanship of to-day
  seems to be less perfect and the materials used more friable. A slight
  direct sinkage before beginning to cut the <span
  class="scac">V</span>-sunk section is a useful method of <!-- Page 11
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span> partially
  atoning for modern shallow cutting, as shadows more directly defining the
  outlines are thus obtained. The student should, however, be warned at the
  outset that all reproductions or tracings from rubbings of ancient
  stone-cut letters are apt to be more or less deceptive, as all the
  accidental variations of the outlines are exaggerated, and where the
  stone of the original has been chipped or worn away it appears in the
  reproduction as though the letter had been actually so cut.</p>

  <p>The photograph of a panel of lettering from the upper part of the Arch
  of Constantine, Rome, shown in <a href="#Fig6">6</a>, well indicates the
  effect of shadows in defining the classic Roman letters; and the effect
  of shadows on an incised letter may be clearly observed by comparing <a
  href="#Fig4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig5">5</a>, the former showing a
  drawing for an inscription in which the Serlio-Ross <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span> alphabet was used as a
  basis for the letter forms, and the latter being a photograph of the same
  inscription, as cut in granite. It will be noted how much narrower the
  thin lines appear when defined only by shadow than in the drawing. The
  model used for the lettering on the frieze of the Boston Public Library,
  <a href="#Fig7">7</a>, which shows some interesting modern forms intended
  for cutting in granite, should be studied for the effect of the cast
  shadows; while <a href="#Fig14">14</a>, a redrawing of inscriptions on
  the Harvard Architectural Building, Cambridge, Mass., exhibits an
  excellent type of letter with widened thin lines for v-cutting in
  sandstone.</p>

  <p>The special requirements of the stone-cut forms for either incised or
  raised inscriptions are, however, quite apart from the subject of this
  book, and are too various to be taken up in greater detail here. It is
  important, nevertheless, that the designer should be reminded always to
  make allowance for the material in which a letter was originally
  executed. Otherwise, if exactly copied in other materials, he may find
  the result annoyingly unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>The examples of letters taken from Roman and Renaissance Italian
  monuments, shown in the pages of this chapter, will illustrate the
  variety of individual letter forms used by the Classic and Renaissance
  designers. The shape of the same letter will often be found to vary in
  the same inscription and even in apparently analogous cases. The
  designers evidently had in mind more than the directly adjacent words,
  and sometimes even considered <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>[16]</span> the relation of their lettering to objects
  outside the panel altogether. This is especially true in the work of the
  Italian Renaissance, which is almost invariably admirable in both
  composition and arrangement.</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig8">8</a> to <a href="#Fig22">22</a> show
  examples, drawn from various sources, which exhibit different treatments
  of the classic Roman letter forms. The differentiation will be found to
  lie largely in the widths of the letters themselves, and in the treatment
  of the serifs, angles, and varying widths of line. Figures <a
  href="#Fig11">11</a> to <a href="#Fig13">13</a> and <a
  href="#Fig16">16</a> to <a href="#Fig22">22</a> are redrawn from rubbings
  <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[17]</span> of
  Roman incised inscriptions. Figures <a href="#Fig16">16</a> and <a
  href="#Fig17">17</a> show beautifully proportioned letters cut in marble
  with unusual care and refinement, considering the large size of the
  originals. A later Roman form of less refinement but of greater strength
  and carrying power, and for that reason better adapted to many modern
  uses, is shown in <a href="#Fig18">18</a> and <a href="#Fig19">19</a>. In
  this case the original letters were cut about seven and <!-- Page 27
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[27]</span> one-half inches
  high. The letters in <a href="#Fig20">20</a> are curiously modern in
  character. Part of the panel of Roman lettering shown in <a
  href="#Fig21">21</a> exhibits the use of a form very like that shown in
  <a href="#Fig18">18</a> and <a href="#Fig19">19</a>. Figure <a
  href="#Fig11">11</a> shows a detail composed in a quite representative
  fashion; while on the other hand figure <a href="#Fig12">12</a> depicts a
  Roman letter of quite unusual character, and of a form evidently adapted
  from pen work, in which the shapes are narrow and crowded, while the

  <p>After the fall of Rome and during the Dark Ages the practice of
  lettering, at least in so far as the Roman form was concerned, was
  distinctly retrograde. With the advent of the Renaissance, however, the
  purest classic forms were revived; and indeed the Italian Renaissance
  seems to have been the golden age of lettering. With the old Roman
  fragments of the best period constantly before their eyes the Renaissance
  artists of Italy seem to have grasped the true spirit of classicism; and
  their work somehow acquired a refinement and delicacy lacking in even the
  best of the Roman examples. As much of the Italian Renaissance lettering
  was intended for use on tombs or monuments where it might be seen at
  close range, and was cut in fine marble, the increased refinement may be
  due, at least in part, to different conditions.</p>

  <p>The panel from Raphael's tomb in the Pantheon, Rome, <a
  href="#Fig30">30</a>, shows a beautiful and pure form of typical
  Renaissance letter; and the composition of the panel is as well worthy
  <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span> of
  careful study as are the letter forms. Figure <a href="#Fig34">34</a>,
  devised from a tomb in Santa Croce, portrays a letter not only beautiful
  in itself, but one which, with two minor changes (for the top bar of the
  T might advantageously be shortened to allow its neighbors to set closer,
  and the M might be finished at the top with a serif, after the usual
  fashion), is exactly applicable to the purposes of the modern
  draughtsman. This type of letter appears to best advantage when used in
  such panel forms as those shown in the rubbing from the Marsuppini tomb,
  <a href="#Fig31">31</a>, and in the floor slab from the same church, <a
  href="#Fig32">32</a>. Two very refined examples, <a href="#Fig28">28</a>
  and <a href="#Fig29">29</a>, also from slabs in Santa Croce, Florence,
  date from about the same period. The latter exhibits the alphabet itself,
  and the former shows a similar letter form as actually used. The letters
  in <a href="#Fig33">33</a>, redrawn from rubbings from the Marsuppini
  tomb, are shown for comparison with the rubbing itself, which is
  reproduced in smaller size in <a href="#Fig31">31</a>. Taken together,
  plates <a href="#Fig30">30</a>, <a href="#Fig31">31</a> and <a
  href="#Fig32">32</a> will fairly represent not only the usual fashion of
  composing Renaissance panels, but capital forms which illustrate some of
  the most excellent work of this period.</p>

  <p>A very different and interesting type of letter was used on many of
  the best medals of the Italian Renaissance (see <a href="#Fig24">24</a>),
  which has been recently adapted and employed by modern medal designers in
  France, as exhibited in figure <a href="#Fig25">25</a>. Although
  absolutely plain, it is, when properly composed, much more effective in
  the service for which it was intended than a more elaborate and fussy
  form; and although sometimes adapted with good results to other uses, it
  is particularly appropriate for casting in metal. Similar forms rendered
  in pen and ink are shown in <a href="#Fig26">26</a>.</p>

  redrawn from the handiwork of Renaissance masters. The capital letters

  purity of form is well <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <a href="#Fig37">37</a> and <a href="#Fig38">38</a>; for Dürer's letters
  were taken as a basis by nearly all such Renaissance designers of
  lettering as Geoffrey Tory, Leonardo da Vinci, etc. It should be observed
  in the Dürer <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Before, during and after the Renaissance movement many local and
  extraneous influences temporarily modified the forms of the Roman
  letters. There are, for instance, numerous examples of lettering in which
  Byzantine and Romanesque traits are strongly apparent, such as the free
  manipulation of the letter forms in order to make them fit into given
  lines and spaces. The drawing of the panel over the doorway of the Badia,
  Florence, <a href="#Fig42">42</a>, notable for the characteristic placing
  and composition of the letters, will serve as a case in point. This
  example is further interesting because it shows how the Uncial form of
  the letter was beginning to react and find a use in stone&mdash;a state
  of affairs which at first glance might seem anomalous, for the Uncial
  letter was distinctly a pen-drawn form; but it was discovered that its
  rounder forms made it particularly useful for inscribing stones which
  were likely to chip or sliver, in carving which it was consequently
  desirable to avoid too acute angles. The Roman letter underwent various
  salient modifications <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span> at the hands of the scribes of
  extra-Italian nations. We find very crude variants of the Roman letter,
  dating hundreds of years after the Roman form had reached its highest
  development; and, on the other hand, some very beautiful and individual
  national variants were produced. The continual interchange of manuscripts
  among the nations on the continent of Europe probably explains the more
  conventional character and strong general resemblance of most of the
  early Continental work; but the scribes of insular England, less
  influenced by contemporary progress and examples, produced forms of
  greater individuality (see <a href="#Fig46">46</a>, <a
  href="#Fig47">47</a>, <a href="#Fig48">48</a>). In Ireland, letter forms
  originally derived from early Roman models were developed through many
  decades with no ulterior influences, and resulted in some wonderfully
  distinctive and beautiful variations of the Roman letters, <!-- Page 47
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span> though the
  beauty of these Irish examples can only be faintly suggested by
  reproductions limited to black and white, and without the decorations of
  the originals.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h2>MODERN ROMAN LETTERS</h2>

  <p>The small or "minuscule" letter that we now use in all printed books
  attained its modern and definitive form only after the invention of
  printing. The first printed books were made to imitate, as closely as
  possible, the handwritten work of the scribes of the early fifteenth
  century, and as printing was first done in Germany, the earliest book
  types were those modeled upon German scripts, somewhat similar to that
  shown in <a href="#Fig141">141</a>, and their condensed or blackletter
  variants. The Italian printers, of a more classical taste, found the
  German types somewhat black and clumsy; for though Gothic characters were
  also used in Italy, they had become lighter and more refined there. The
  Italians, therefore, evolved a new form of type letter, based upon the
  <i>Italian</i> pen letters then in use, which though fundamentally Gothic
  in form had been refined by amalgamation with an earlier letter known as
  the "Caroline", from its origin under the direction of Charlemagne. The
  "Caroline" was in its turn an imitation of the Roman "Half-uncial." The
  close relationship of the first small type letter forms in Italy with the
  current writing hand of the best Italian scribes is well indicated by the
  legend that the "Italic," or sloped small letter, was taken directly from
  the handwriting of Petrarch. The new Italian types, in which classic
  capitals were combined with the newly evolved minuscule <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span> letters, were
  called "Roman" from the city of their origin, and sprang into almost
  immediate popularity, spreading from Italy into England, France and
  Spain. In Germany, on the other hand, the national blackletter form
  persisted, and is still in use to-day.</p>

  <p>The minuscule "Roman" letters thus evolved were developed to their
  most perfect individual forms by the master-printers of Venice; and it is
  to the models which they produced that we must revert to-day when we
  attempt to devise or reproduce an elegant small letter of any
  conservative form. The modern pen draughtsman should bear in mind,
  however, that, perfect as such forms of letters may be for the uses of
  the printer, the limitations of type have necessarily curtailed the
  freedom and variety of their serif and swash lines, and that therefore,
  though accepting their basic forms, he need not be cramped by their
  restrictions, nor imitate the unalterable and sometimes awkwardly
  inartistic relations of letter to letter for which he finds precedents in
  the printed page. Indeed, the same general rules for spacing and the same
  freedom in the treatment of the serifs, kerns and swash lines are quite
  as applicable to pen-drawn small letters as to the capital forms. The
  only true path of progress lies in this freedom of treatment; and if the
  same fertile artists of the Renaissance who have bequeathed to us such
  beautiful examples of their unfettered use of the capital had used the
  minuscule also, we should undoubtedly possess small letters of far more
  graceful and adaptable forms than those which we now have.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#Fig50">50</a> and <a href="#Fig51">51</a> may be found an
  attempt to formulate a scheme to assist in the reconstruction of an
  alphabet of Roman small letters, after somewhat the same fashion as <!--
  Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span> that
  devised for the Roman capitals by Mr. Ross, in <a href="#Fig1">1</a> and
  <a href="#Fig2">2</a>. A small-letter diagram must, for obvious reasons,
  be less exact and detailed than one for the more defined capital form;
  but the diagram given will serve to determine sufficiently the main
  outlines and proportions. In their shapes the letters shown in <a
  href="#Fig50">50</a> and <a href="#Fig51">51</a> adhere fairly closely to
  the best type forms of the small letter; and the drawing will serve,
  further, to show the space generally allowed by modern founders between
  one lower-case letter and another when set into type words. This spacing
  is based on the m of the fount employed. The open space between all but
  k, w and y (in which the outlines of the letters themselves hold them
  further away from their neighbors) and the round letters being the space
  between the upright strokes of the m; an interval represented in the
  diagram by a square and a half. The round letters, as has already been
  said in speaking of the capital forms, should be spaced nearer together;
  and it will be observed that they are only separated by one square in the
  diagram. Although suggestive, the rules which govern the spacing of types
  are not to be blindly followed by the pen letterer. In type, for
  instance, it would be impossible, for mechanical reasons, to allow the
  kerns of the f, j and y to project far over the body of the next letter,
  and in these letters the kerns consequently have either to be restrained
  or the letters spaced farther apart. In pen lettering, however, the
  designer is not restrained by such limitations, and his spacing of
  letters should be governed solely by the effect.</p>

  <p>The disposition of the accented lines in the small letters follow the
  same general rules that govern those of the capitals (see page <a
  href="#page2">2</a>); the only deviation being in the case of <!-- Page
  57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[57]</span> the g, in
  which the shading of the bottom seems to have been determined largely by
  the effect upon the eye.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed in the diagram that the "ascenders" of the smaller
  letters rise about three squares to their extreme top points above the
  body of the letter; that the body of each letter is inclosed in a square
  that is three units high, and that the "descenders" fall but two squares
  below the letter body. These proportions are not by any means invariable,
  however, and indeed there is no fixed rule by which the proportions of
  ascenders and descenders to the body of the Roman minuscule may be
  determined. In some forms of the letter both are of the same length, and
  sometimes that length is the same as the body height of the letter. In
  general a better result is obtained by making both ascenders and
  descenders of less than the length of the body, and keeping the
  descenders shorter than the ascenders in about the proportion of
  two-fifths to three-fifths.</p>

  <p>Parallel lines of small letters cannot be spaced closer to each other
  than the ascenders and descenders will allow; the projections above and
  below the line are awkward, and interrupt the definite lines of
  demarkation at the top and bottom of the letter-bodies; the capitals
  necessarily used in connection with the small letters add to the
  irregularity of the line&mdash;all of which reasons combine to limit the
  employment of minuscule for formal or monumental uses. On the other hand,
  the small letter form is excellently adapted for the printed page, where
  the occasional capitals but tend to break the monotony, while the
  ascenders and descenders strongly characterize and increase the
  legibility of the letter forms.</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig52">52</a> to <a href="#Fig59">59</a> show
  several forms of small letter alphabets; those shown in <a
  href="#Fig52">52</a> to <a href="#Fig56">56</a> being taken from "Writing
  books" by Spanish and Italian writing masters. These writing masters
  often chose to show their skill by imitating type forms of letters with
  the pen, but though similar in the individual forms of the letters the
  written examples exhibit a freedom and harmony in composition impossible
  for type to equal, and therefore are immeasurably more interesting to the
  modern penman. Figure <a href="#Fig61">61</a> illustrates a type form of
  minuscule which may be commended for study. Other examples of small
  letters by modern designers will be found in <a href="#Fig105">105</a>,

  <p>The minuscule alphabet by Mr. Claude Fayette Bragdon, <a
  href="#Fig59">59</a>, is a carefully worked-out form which in its lines
  closely follows a type face devised by Jenson, the celebrated Venetian
  printer who flourished toward the end of the sixteenth century. This
  example together with those shown in <a href="#Fig50">50</a>, <a
  href="#Fig51">51</a> and <a href="#Fig56">56</a> exhibits some
  conservative variations of the standard models for minuscule letters; and
  the same may be said of the modern type faces shown in <a
  href="#Fig62">62</a>, <a href="#Fig63">63</a> and <a
  href="#Fig64">64</a>. The various other examples of the small-letter
  forms illustrated evidence how original and interesting modifications of
  conservative shapes may be evolved without appreciable loss of
  legibility.</p>

  <p>Figure <a href="#Fig61">61</a> shows the capital, small letter and
  italic forms of a type based on old Venetian models, cut by William
  Caslon in the early part of the eighteenth century, and ever <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span> since known by
  his name. This face has comparatively recently been revived by modern
  type-founders; and though this revival has provided us with a text letter
  far superior to the forms previously in use, the modern imitation falls
  short of the beauty of Caslon's original, as may be seen by comparing the
  letters shown in <a href="#Fig61">61</a>, which are reproduced from
  Caslon's specimen-book, issued by him about the middle of the eighteenth
  century, with the type used in printing this volume, which is a good
  modern "Caslon."</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig62">62</a> to <a href="#Fig67">67</a> show some
  newly devised type faces, all designed by artists of reputation. Figure
  <a href="#Fig62">62</a> illustrates a fount called the "Montaigne" which
  has been recently completed by Mr. Bruce Rogers for the Riverside Press,
  Cambridge, Mass., and cut under his immediate direction, with especial
  insistance upon an unmechanical treatment of serifs, etc. As a result the
  "Montaigne" is, for type, remarkable in its artistic freedom, and its
  forms are well worthy the study of the designer. Both its capitals and
  small letters suggest the purity of the Italian Renaissance shapes. The
  letters space rather farther apart than in most types, and the result
  makes for legibility. Although several other modern faces of type have
  been designed on much the same lines, notably one for The Dove's Press in
  England, the "Montaigne" seems the best of them all, because of its
  freedom, and its absolute divorce from the overdone, exaggerated,
  heavy-faced effects of the Morris styles of type.</p>

  <p>Mr. De Vinne of the De Vinne Press, New York City, has introduced a
  new type called the "Renner", <a href="#Fig63">63</a>, which was
  originally cut for some of the Grolier Club's publications. The letters
  were first photographed from a selected page of Renner's
  "Quadrigesimale," then <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span> carefully studied and redrawn before the
  punches were cut. Mr. De Vinne has added small capitals and italics to
  the fount, as well as dotted letters to serve as substitutes for the
  italic for those who prefer them. The "Renner" type would have been more
  effective on a larger body; but for commercial usefulness it is generally
  deemed expedient to employ as small a body as the face of a type will
  allow. Mr. De Vinne notes, in this connection, that all the important
  types of the early printers were large, and that a fount designed to-day
  with regard only to its artistic effectiveness would be cast upon a large
  body and be of good size.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bertram G. Goodhue has designed two founts of Roman type, and is
  now at work on a Blackletter face. His first fount, cut for Mr. D. B.
  Updike, of the Merrymount Press, Boston, and known as the "Merrymount,"
  is shown in <a href="#Fig64">64</a>. Intended for large pages and rough
  paper it necessarily shows to disadvantage in the example given, where
  the blackness and weight of the letters makes them seem clumsy, despite
  the refinement of their forms.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The "Cheltenham Old Style," <a href="#Fig65">65</a>, is the other
  Roman face recently designed by the same artist. It was cut for the
  Cheltenham Press of New York City; and embodies in its present form many
  ideas suggested by Mr. Ingalls Kimball of that press. Observe especially
  the excess in length of the ascenders over the descenders, and that the
  serifs have been reduced to the minimum. Contrary to the usual custom in
  type cutting, the round letters do not run above or below the guide
  lines. The capitals compose excellently; but the small letters are too
  closely spaced and seem too square for the best effect, and weight has
  been obtained by so thickening the lines that much delicacy and variety
  has been lost. <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[72]</span> The "Cheltenham Old Style" is, however,
  very legible when composed into words, and is effective on the page.</p>

  <p>Any attempt to get the effect of Blackletter with the Roman form is
  likely to result clumsily. The celebrated Roman faces designed by William
  Morris (too familiar to require reproduction here) are, despite their
  real beauty, over-black on the page, and awkward when examined in detail.
  While the stimulus Morris's work gave to typography was much needed at
  that time, the present reaction toward more refined faces is most
  gratifying. By precept and example Mr. Morris produced a salutary revolt
  against the too thin and light and mechanical type faces before in use,
  but he went too far in the opposite direction, and we are now certainly
  falling back upon a more desirable mean.</p>

  <p>Mr. Herbert P. Horne is at present designing a new fount of type for
  the Merrymount Press, Boston, to be <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[73]</span> known as the "Mont'
  Allegro," which seems, from the designs so far as at present completed,
  likely to prove in some respects the most scholarly and severe of modern
  faces.</p>

  <p>The Greek type designed for the Macmillan Company of England, by Mr.
  Selwyn Image, <a href="#Fig66">66</a>, is of sufficient interest to be
  shown here, despite the fact that it is not strictly germane to our
  subject. In this face Mr. Image has <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[74]</span> returned to the more
  classic Greek form, although the result may at first glance seem
  illegible to the reader familiar with the more common cursive
  letters.</p>

  <p>The type shown in <a href="#Fig67">67</a> is a new English face
  designed by Mr. C.&nbsp;R. Ashbee for a prayerbook for the King. Interesting
  as it is, it seems in many ways too extreme and eccentric to be wholly
  satisfactory: the very metal of type would seem to postulate a less
  "tricky" treatment.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to attempt a discrimination between the various
  national styles of pen letters which the recently revived interest in the
  art of lettering is producing; and it is especially worth while to note
  that the activity seems, even in Germany, to be devoted almost
  exclusively to the development and variation of the Roman forms. It is
  noteworthy, too, after so long a period of the dull copying of bad forms,
  and particularly of bad type forms, that the modern trend is distinctly
  in the direction of freedom; though this freedom is more marked in French
  and German <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>[75]</span> than in English or American work. Hand in
  hand with this increased freedom of treatment has naturally come a
  clearer disclosure of the mediums employed; and indeed in much of the
  best modern work the designer has so far lent himself to his tools that
  the tools themselves have, in great measure, become responsible for the
  resulting letter forms. <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>[76]</span> Moreover modern designers are showing a
  welcome attention to minuscule letters, and it even seems possible that
  before long some small letter forms that shall be distinctively of the
  pen may be developed, and that the use of type models for minuscule pen
  letters will no longer be found necessary or commendable.</p>

  <p>Another noticeable tendency in modern lettering seems to be the
  gradual promotion of small letter forms to the dignity of capitals, (see
  <a href="#Fig79">79</a> and <a href="#Fig98">98</a> for examples) in much
  the same way as the Uncial letter and its immediate derivatives produced
  the present small letter. It is surely to be hoped that this movement may
  not lose vitality before it has had time to enrich us with some new and
  excellent forms.</p>

  <p>The influence of nationality is strongly shown in the modern lettering
  of all countries; and it is generally as easy to recognize a specimen as
  the work of a German, French, English, or American artist, respectively,
  no matter how individual he may be, as it is to tell the difference
  between the work of two different designers.</p>

  <p>The modern German seems to have an undeniable freshness of outlook on
  the Roman alphabet. He treats it with a freedom and variety and a certain
  disregard of precedent&mdash;induced, perhaps, by his schooling in
  Blackletter&mdash;that often produces delightful, though sometimes, be it
  added, direful results. But if the extreme and bizarre forms be thrown
  aside the designer may obtain suggestions of great benefit and value from
  the more restrained examples of German work. Many eminent German
  draughtsmen, whose work is all too little known in this country, are <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[84]</span> using
  letters with the same distinction that has of late years marked their
  purely decorative work, as the specimens shown in <a href="#Fig68">68</a>
  to <a href="#Fig76">76</a> will evidence. Figures <a href="#Fig68">68</a>
  and <a href="#Fig75">75</a> show forms which are perhaps especially
  representative of the general modern tendency in German work and many
  German artists are using letters of very similar general forms to these
  although, of course, with individual variations. Figures <a
  href="#Fig70">70</a> and <a href="#Fig73">73</a> show two very original
  and pleasing styles, also markedly German. In spite of the national drift
  toward the Roman, much modern German lettering still takes the Gothic and
  Blackletter forms; and the specimen reproduced in <a href="#Fig71">71</a>
  shows a curious combination of the Gothic, Uncial and Roman forms
  pervaded by the German spirit. The beautiful lettering in <a
  href="#Fig72">72</a> seems to have been inspired from a stone-cut Uncial.
  Figure <a href="#Fig74">74</a> shows an almost strictly Roman letter, and
  yet is as unmistakably German in handling as any of the other examples
  shown.</p>

  <p>Among the examples of modern French lettering, those shown in <a
  href="#Fig78">78</a> and <a href="#Fig79">79</a> are perhaps the most
  typical of the modern school. This style of letter was given its most
  consistent form by the joint efforts of M.&nbsp;P. Verneuil and some of the
  pupils of Eugène Grasset, after whose letter it was originally modeled.
  Grasset freely varies his use of this form in his different designs, as
  in <a href="#Fig85">85</a>, but founds many of his best specimens upon
  the earlier French models.</p>

  <p>M. George Auriol has extended the modern use of drawn letters by
  publishing a number of small books which he has handwritten throughout,
  although the form of letter he generally uses for this purpose is purely
  modern and not at all like the texts of the medieval scribes. M. Auriol's
  letter is beautifully clear, readable and original; "brushy" in its
  technique, yet suitable for rapid writing. He calls <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span> it a "Cursive" letter,
  and has recently made designs for its use in type. The page shown in <a
  href="#Fig83">83</a> is from the preface to a book of his well-known
  designs for monograms, and the entire text is written in this cursive
  form. The individual letters of this "Cursive" may be more easily studied
  in <a href="#Fig84">84</a>. The cover for "L'Image", <a
  href="#Fig81">81</a>, shows the same designer's use of a more
  conventional Roman form.</p>

  <p>The poster by M. Theo. van Rysselberghe shown in <a
  href="#Fig77">77</a> exhibits two interesting forms of French small
  letters that are worthy of study and suggestive for development.</p>

  <p>M. Alphons Mucha employs a distinctive letter, especially fitted to
  his technique, which he uses almost invariably, <a
  href="#Fig82">82</a>.</p>

  <p>Much recent French lettering inclines toward a certain formlessness,
  that, although sometimes admirable when regarded merely from the point of
  view of harmony with the design, has little value otherwise. A typical
  specimen of such formless lettering is that shown in the very charming
  <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span>
  "Revue Blanche" poster, <a href="#Fig80">80</a>. Excellent when
  considered with the design, the lettering alone makes but an indifferent
  showing.</p>

  <p>The Italian designers of letters have not yet evolved any very
  distinctive national forms. In many ways Italian work resembles the
  German. It has less originality, but greater subtlety and refinement.</p>

  <p>The strongest personality among modern British letterers is Mr. Walter
  Crane. Characteristic examples of his work are shown in <a
  href="#Fig86">86</a>, <a href="#Fig87">87</a>, <a href="#Fig88">88</a>
  and <a href="#Fig89">89</a>. Although sometimes apparently careless and
  too often rough, his lettering has the merit and charm of invariably
  disclosing the instrument and the material employed. Mr. Crane is
  especially fond of an Uncial pen form, which he varies with masterful
  freedom. It may be mentioned in passing that he is perhaps the only
  designer who has been able to make the wrongly accented <span
  class="scac">Q</span> seem consistent (compare <a href="#Fig86">86</a>),
  or who has conquered its swash tail when the letter is accented in this
  unusual way.</p>

<p><!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>[93]</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Lewis F. Day has become a recognized authority on lettering, both
  through his writings and his handiwork. His great versatility makes it
  difficult to select a specimen which may be taken as characteristic of
  his work; but perhaps the lettering shown in <a href="#Fig95">95</a> is
  as representative as any that could be chosen. Among his designs the
  magazine cover, <a href="#Fig93">93</a>, is an unusually free and
  effective composition, and its letter forms possess the variety required
  to satisfy the eye when so much of the whole effect of the design depends
  upon them.</p>

  <p>The style of lettering ordinarily employed by Mr. Selwyn Image&mdash;a

  <p>The name of Mr. Charles Ricketts is intimately associated with the

  <p>Mr. J. W. Simpson, one of the younger British draughtsmen, uses a
  graceful and interestingly linked Roman form shown in the panel from a

  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[95]</span> letter by the same
  artist, <a href="#Fig91">91</a>, is fairly representative of a style
  recently come into vogue among the younger British draughtsmen, which is
  related to a form of letter brought into fashion by the new English
  school of designers on wood, among whom may be mentioned Mr. William
  Nicholson and Mr. Gordon Craig, both of whom have done lettering
  distinguished by its indication of the medium employed. Figure <a

  their letters, <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>In illustrating the lettering of American artists it has been
  unfortunately found necessary to omit the work of many well-known
  designers, either because their usual style of lettering is too similar

  the letters they commonly employ are not distinctive or individual.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edwin A. Abbey is a notable example of an artist who has not
  disdained to expend both time and practice on such a minor art as
  lettering <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span> that he might be able to letter his own
  designs, as the beautiful page, shown in <a href="#Fig153">153</a> in the
  succeeding chapter, will sufficiently prove. The lettering of the
  title-page for Herrick's poems, <a href="#Fig101">101</a>, by the same
  draughtsman, is likewise excellent, being both original and appropriate.
  The letters in both these examples are modeled after old work, and both
  display an unusually keen grasp of the limitations and possibilities of
  the forms employed, especially in the former, <a href="#Fig153">153</a>,
  where the use of capitals to form words is particularly noteworthy, while
  in general composition and spacing the spirit of the letter used (compare

  <p>Mr. Edward Penfield's work first attracted attention through the
  series of posters which he designed for 'Harper's Magazine' with
  unfailing fertility of invention for several years. During this time he
  evolved a style of letter which exactly fitted the character of his work.
  The cover design shown in <a href="#Fig103">103</a> displays his
  characteristic letter in actual use; while the two interesting pages of
  large and small letter alphabets by him, <a href="#Fig104">104</a> and <a
  href="#Fig105">105</a>, show the latest and best development of these
  letter forms. The heading <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[102]</span> shown in <a href="#Fig102">102</a>
  exhibits a slightly different letter, evidently based upon that used by
  Mr. Penfield.</p>

  <p>The capitals by Mr. H. Van B. Magonigle, shown in <a
  href="#Fig107">107</a>, are derived from classic Roman forms but treated
  with a modern freedom that makes them unusually attractive. They appear,
  however, to better advantage in actual use in conjunction with a design,

  name="page104"></a>[104]</span> most facile and careful letterer.
  Although his name is more intimately associated with Blackletter
  (examples of his work in that style are shown in the following chapter),
  he has devised some very interesting variations of the Roman forms, such
  as that used in <a href="#Fig108">108</a>, as an example.</p>

  <p>Mr. Will Bradley uses a very individual style of the Roman capital,
  often marked by a peculiar exaggeration in the width of the round
  letters, contrasted with narrow tall forms in such letters as <span
  class="scac">E</span>, <span class="scac">F</span> and <span
  class="scac">L</span>. Mr. Bradley has become more free and
  unconventional in his later work, but his specimens have always been
  noteworthy for beauty of line and spacing; see <a href="#Fig111">111</a>.
  Figure <a href="#Fig109">109</a> shows his employment of a brush-made

  <p>Mr. Maxfield Parrish commonly employs a widely spaced letter,
  fashioned closely after the old German models, beautiful in its forms,
  and displaying the individuality of the artist in its composition. The
  form and use of Mr. Parrish's usual letter is well shown in <a

  <p>The form of letter preferred by Mr. Claude Fayette Bragdon is
  represented by the page of small letters, <a href="#Fig59">59</a>, which,
  as we have already said, are closely modeled on the type alphabet
  designed by Jenson. In Mr. Bragdon's version they represent an
  excellently useful and conservative style of small letter. They are shown
  in use, with harmonious capitals and italics, in the 'Literature' cover
  design, <a href="#Fig121">121</a>. In the small book-plate, reproduced in
  <a href="#Fig120">120</a>, Mr. <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span> Bragdon has used a very graceful variant,
  especially noteworthy for its freedom of serif treatment; and in the
  letter-heading, <a href="#Fig122">122</a>, he has employed an attractive
  capital of still different character.</p>

  <p>Mr. H. L. Bridwell has originated the singularly excellent letter
  shown in <a href="#Fig124">124</a>, which is founded upon some of the
  modern French architectural forms. He uses it with great freedom and
  variety in spacing according to the effect that he desires to produce. In
  one instance he will jam the letters together in an oddly crowded line,
  while in another we find them spread far apart, but always with excellent
  results as regards the design as a whole. Something of this variation of
  spacing is shown in <a href="#Fig123">123</a>. In the numerous theatrical
  posters which Mr. Bridwell has designed&mdash;and which too seldom bear
  his signature&mdash;he employs a great variety of lettering. Sometimes,
  of course, the freedom of his work is restricted by the conservatism of
  clients; but often the letter forms here illustrated add to the style and
  distinction of his designs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Frank Hazenplug, the author of much clever decorative lettering,
  has evolved a very black and striking style of capital that still retains
  grace. Figures <a href="#Fig125">125</a> and <a href="#Fig126">126</a>
  show two sets of Mr. Hazenplug's capitals. A book cover on which he has
  used small letters in an original way is reproduced in <a
  href="#Fig127">127</a>. Figure <a href="#Fig129">129</a> shows the
  employment of a heavy-faced letter similar to that exhibited in alphabet
  <a href="#Fig126">126</a>, but suggestive in its serif treatment of Mr.
  Penfield's letter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Edwards employs a letter, <a href="#Fig128">128</a>, which,

  <p>Mr. Guernsey Moore's letters shown in <a href="#Fig130">130</a> are
  naturally better both in intrinsic form, spacing and composition than the
  widely used "Post Old Style" types which were based upon them. The large
  and small letters displayed in <a href="#Fig133">133</a> show a form
  that, at the present writing, seems to be in considerable favor. It is,
  however, too extreme, and its peculiarities are too exaggerated to allow
  it to become a permanent style. But like the extravagant German forms
  <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span>
  already referred to, it has also apparent advantages; and a few of its
  characteristics are not unlikely to survive in some more conservative
  adaptation.</p>

  <p>The letter by Mr. Harry Everett Townsend shown in <a

  form of the rapidly drawn character shown in <a
  href="#Fig138">138</a>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Howard Pyle often gives us charming bits of lettering in
  connection with his illustrations. The heading, <a
  href="#Fig132">132</a>, shows a characteristic line. Most of Mr. Pyle's
  lettering is "Colonial" or Georgian in style, though the initials he uses
  with it are generally rendered in the fashions of the early German
  woodcuts, somewhat similar to Holbein's initials for the "Dance of
  Death."</p>

  <p>One of the most original of American letterers is Mr. Orson Lowell.
  Usually closely conjoined with design, his lettering does not show to its
  full value when reproduced apart from its surroundings, for much of its
  charm depends <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>[118]</span> upon its harmony in line and color with
  the accompanying drawing Mr. Lowell has taken the same basic forms as
  those used by Mr. Penfield, and has played with them until he has
  developed a series of most ingenious and fanciful letters. The examples
  reproduced in <a href="#Fig136">136</a> and <a href="#Fig137">137</a> but
  inadequately show a few of the many forms that Mr. Lowell employs with
  remarkable fertility of invention and delightfully decorative effect of
  line. The small letters, <a href="#Fig135">135</a>, shown opposite his
  capitals, <a href="#Fig134">134</a>, are not by Mr. Lowell, nor are they
  in any way equal to his own small letters, of which regrettably few
  appear in his published work; but they may serve to exhibit a similar
  method of treating a much more conventional form of minuscule than Mr.
  <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>
  Lowell would himself use for the same purpose. Despite its
  unconventionally, however, an examination of Mr. Lowell's work will show
  that each letter has been developed to fit the space between its
  neighbors and to balance and relieve their forms; and that, fanciful as
  some of the shapes may appear, they have invariably been knowingly worked
  out, and always appear harmonious and fit.</p>

  <p>The pages of letters shown in <a href="#Fig138">138</a>, <a
  href="#Fig139">139</a> and <a href="#Fig140">140</a> are intended to
  suggest forms which, while suitable for rapid use, yet possess some
  individuality and character. The so-called "Cursive" letter by Mr.
  Maxfield Parrish, <a href="#Fig140">140</a>, is particularly effective
  for such informal use&mdash;in fact, its very charm lies in its
  informality&mdash;and is quite as distinctively "pen-ny" as any of Mr.
  Crane's work of the same kind.</p>

  <p>A glance over the field of modern examples will disclose, first, a
  general tendency to break away from the older type models in pen-drawn
  forms; second, a growing partiality for the small letter, and third, a
  sporadic disposition to use capital and minuscule forms interchangeably.
  The first <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span> trend may be noticed by comparing the
  letter shown in <a href="#Fig132">132</a>, which is closely modeled after
  type, with that shown in <a href="#Fig136">136</a>, in which an opposite
  method is followed, and the letters are so treated in handling form and
  color as to best harmonize with the design itself. The possibilities
  latent in the small letter are indicated by such interesting uses as
  those shown in figures <a href="#Fig77">77</a>, <a href="#Fig89">89</a>,
  <a href="#Fig98">98</a>, <a href="#Fig101">101</a>, <a
  href="#Fig111">111</a>, <a href="#Fig112">112</a>, <a
  href="#Fig121">121</a>, <a href="#Fig127">127</a>, <a
  href="#Fig130">130</a> and <a href="#Fig131">131</a>. American designers
  seem to be especially interested in the development of the small letter.
  Of the intermingling of the capital and small letter shapes examples may
  be found in figures <a href="#Fig71">71</a>, <a href="#Fig75">75</a>, <a
  href="#Fig77">77</a>, <a href="#Fig78">78</a>, <a href="#Fig79">79</a>,
  <a href="#Fig82">82</a>, <a href="#Fig83">83</a>, <a
  href="#Fig84">84</a>, <a href="#Fig98">98</a>, <a href="#Fig127">127</a>
  and <a href="#Fig134">134</a>. In these examples it will be noted that
  the minuscules seem to be more easily transformed into capitals than do
  the capitals into minuscules; only a few of the latter appearing to lend
  themselves harmoniously to the small letter guise.</p>

  <p>Such tendencies as these, if allowed to develop slowly and naturally,
  are certain to evolve new forms&mdash;a process of modification which it
  should be fully as instructive and entertaining to observe as any of the

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h2>GOTHIC LETTERS</h2>

  <p>The name "Gothic" applies rather to the spirit than to the exact
  letter forms of the style. The same spirit of freedom and restlessness
  characterises the architecture of the period wherein this style of letter
  was developed; and Gothic letters are in many ways akin to the
  fundamental forms of Gothic architecture. Their effect is often tiring
  and confusing to the eye because of the constant recurrence of very
  similar forms with different letter meanings; yet this very similarity is
  the main cause of the pleasing aspect of a page of Gothic lettering.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Roman letters, which attained a complete and final
  development, Gothic letters never reached authoritative and definitive
  forms, any more than did Gothic architecture. Every individual Gothic
  letter has several quasi-authoritative shapes, and all of these variants
  may be accepted, as long as they display an intelligent conception of the
  spirit of the style as a whole. Because of this lack of finality,
  however, it is impossible to analyze each of the letter forms as we were
  able to do with the Roman alphabet in Chapter I; yet this very
  variability and variety constitute at once the peculiar beauty of Gothic
  and the great difficulty of so drawing it as to preserve its distinctive
  character.</p>

  <p>Any letter of Gothic form is usually called either "Gothic" or
  "Blackletter" indiscriminately, but this use is inexact <!-- Page 128
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[128]</span> and
  confusing. The term "Blackletter" should, strictly, be applied only to
  letters in which the amount of black in the line overbalances the white;
  and the proper application of the title should be determined rather by
  this balance or weight of the letter than by its form.</p>

    141.
  </div>
  <p>The original Gothic letter was a gradual outgrowth from the round
  Roman Uncial. Its early forms retained all the roundness of its Uncial
  parent; but as the advantages of a condensed form of letter for the
  saving of space became manifest, (parchment was expensive and bulky) and
  the <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>[131]</span> beauty of the resulting blacker page was
  noticed, the round Gothic forms were written closer and narrower, the
  ascenders and descenders were shortened, with marked loss of legibilty,
  that the lines of lettering might be brought closer together, until a
  form was evolved in which the black overbalanced the white&mdash;the
  Blackletter which still survives in the common German text of to-day.
  Thus, though a Gothic letter may not be a Blackletter, a Blackletter is
  <i>always</i> Gothic, because it is constructed upon Gothic lines. On the
  other hand, a Roman Blackletter would be an obvious impossibility. The
  very essential and fundamental quality of a Roman letter lies in the
  squareness or circularity of its skeleton form.</p>

  <p>For clearness and convenience, then, the following discrimination
  between the terms Gothic and Blackletter will be adopted in this
  treatise: When a letter is Gothic but not a Blackletter it will be called
  "Round Gothic"; when it is primarily a Blackletter it will be termed
  "Blackletter," the latter name being restricted to such compressed,
  narrow or angular forms as the small letters shown in <a
  href="#Fig144">144</a>, <a href="#Fig147">147</a> and <a
  href="#Fig148">148</a>. The name "Round Gothic" will be applied only to
  the earlier forms, such as those shown in <a href="#Fig141">141</a> and
  <a href="#Fig142">142</a>. Such a distinction has not, I believe,
  hitherto been attempted; but the confusion which otherwise results makes
  the discrimination seem advisable.</p>

  <p>The three pages of examples, figures <a href="#Fig141">141</a>, <a
  href="#Fig142">142</a> and <a href="#Fig143">143</a>, exhibit the
  characteristic forms and standard variations of the Round Gothic. In lieu
  of any detailed analysis of these letter shapes, it may perhaps be
  sufficient to say that they were wholly and exactly determined by the
  position of the quill, which was held rigidly upright, after the fashion
  <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>
  already described in speaking of Roman lettering; and that the letters
  were always formed with a round swinging motion of hand and arm, as their
  forms and accented lines clearly evidence; for the medieval scribes used
  the Round Gothic as an easy and legible handwritten form, and linked many
  of the letters.</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig158">158</a>, <a href="#Fig170">170</a>, <a
  href="#Fig172">172</a> and <a href="#Fig173">173</a> show some capitals
  adapted for use with these Round Gothic letters; but the beginner should
  be extremely wary of attempting to use any Gothic capitals alone to form
  words, as their outlines are not suited for inter-juxtaposition.
  Occasionally they may thus be used, and used effectively, as is shown,
  for instance, in the beautiful page of lettering by Mr. Edwin A. Abbey,
  <a href="#Fig153">153</a>; but so successful a solution is rare, and
  implies an intimate knowledge of the historic examples and use of Gothic
  lettering.</p>

  <p>The late Gothic or Blackletter is condensed and narrowed in the
  extreme. No circles are employed in the construction of the small
  letters, which have angular and generally acute corners. As in all
  pen-drawn letters, the broad lines are made on the down right-sloping
  strokes, and the narrow lines are at right angles to these. Blackletter
  shapes, like those of the Round Gothic, cannot, as has been said, be
  defined by any set of general rules; the intrinsic quality of all Gothic
  letters almost demands a certain freedom of treatment that would
  transgress any laws that could be formulated. Indeed the individual forms
  should always be subservient to the effect of the line or page. Observe
  in almost every example shown how the form of the same letter constantly
  varies in some minor detail. The drawing by Albrecht Dürer, reproduced in
  <a href="#Fig144">144</a>, will, <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span> however, serve to show
  the construction of an excellent Blackletter, which may fairly be
  considered as typical.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The first essential of a good Blackletter line or page is that it
  shall be of a uniform color. Unlike the Roman, the Blackletter form does
  not permit that one word be wider spaced than others in the same panel.
  The amount of white left between the several letters should be as nearly
  as possible the same throughout, approximately the same as the space
  between the perpendicular strokes of the minuscule letters themselves.
  Usually, the less the white space the better will be the general effect
  of the page, for its beauty depends much upon a general blackness of
  aspect;&mdash;and let it be noted in passing that, for this reason, it is
  doubly difficult to judge of the final effect of a Blackletter page from
  any outlined pencil sketch. Even in the cases of those capital letters
  that extend both above and below the guide lines it will be found
  possible to so adjust the spaces <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[135]</span> and blacks as not to
  interrupt the general uniformity of color, and it is sometimes advisable
  to fill awkward blanks by flourishes; although flourishing, even in
  Blackletter, is an amusement that should be indulged in cautiously. As a
  general rule the more solidly black a panel of Blackletter is the better
  (a principle too often disregarded in the modern use of the form); though
  on the other hand, the less legible the individual letters will become.
  The designer should therefore endeavor to steer a middle course, making
  his panel as black as he can without rendering the individual letters
  illegible.</p>

  <p>No style permits more of liberty in the treatment of its separate
  letter forms than the Blackletter. The same letter may require a
  different outline at the beginning of a word than in the middle or at the
  end. The ascenders and descenders may be drawn so short as hardly to
  transcend the guide lines of the minuscules, or may grow into <!-- Page
  136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[136]</span>
  flourishes up and down, to the right or to the left, to fill awkward
  blanks. Indeed so variable are these forms that in ancient examples it is
  often difficult to recognize an individual letter apart from its
  context.</p>

  <p>The two pages drawn by Mr. Goodhue, <a href="#Fig188">188</a> and <a
  href="#Fig189">189</a>, deserve careful study as examples of modern use
  of the Blackletter. It will be observed that almost as many variants of
  each letter are employed as the number used would permit, thus giving the
  panel variety and preventing any appearance of monotony or rigidity.
  Notice the freedom and variety of the swash lines in the capitals, and
  yet that each version is quite as graceful, logical and original as any
  of its variants.</p>

  <p>The examples of old lettering reproduced in figures <a
  href="#Fig147">147</a>, <a href="#Fig148">148</a> and <a
  href="#Fig149">149</a>, together with the drawings by Mr. Goodhue, will
  indicate the proper spacing of Blackletter; but in most of the pages here
  devoted to illustrating the individual forms the letters have been spaced
  too wide for their proper effect that each separate shape might be shown
  distinctly. The style appears at its best in compositions which fill a
  panel of more or less geometrical form, as, for example, the beautiful
  title-page reproduced in <a href="#Fig147">147</a>. Could anything be
  more delightful to the eye than its rich blackness, energetic lines, and
  refreshing virility? In this design surely we have a specimen that, from
  the proportion and balance of its blacks, is more effective than anything
  which could have been accomplished by the use of the more rigid Roman
  letter; but despite its many beauties it suffers from the inherent
  weakness of the individual letter forms,&mdash;it is more effective than
  readable!</p>

  <p>Another excellent example of the old use of Blackletter is the page
  from the prayerbook of the Emperor Maximilian, <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span> shown in <a
  href="#Fig148">148</a>, in which observe again the variety of the
  individual letter forms. Figure <a href="#Fig149">149</a> shows the use
  of a Blackletter on an admirable monumental brass, which is reputed to
  have been designed by Albrecht Dürer. A similar Blackletter form, also
  from a brass, is shown at larger scale in <a href="#Fig186">186</a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span></p>

  <p>Any of the minuscule forms of Blackletter which have been illustrated
  may be used with the Gothic capitals of figures <a
  href="#Fig164">164</a>-5, <a href="#Fig166">166</a>, <a
  href="#Fig177">177</a>, <a href="#Fig179">179</a>, <a
  href="#Fig185">185</a>, <a href="#Fig188">188</a>-9; or with such Uncial
  capitals as are illustrated in <a href="#Fig155">155</a> to <a
  href="#Fig162">162</a>; care being taken, of course, that these capitals
  are made to agree in style and weight with the small letters chosen.
  Although Uncial capitals are historically more closely allied with the
  Round Gothic, we have abundant precedent for their use with the minuscule
  Blackletter in many of the best medieval specimens.</p>

  <p>When the Gothic Uncial capitals were cut in stone and marble there was
  naturally a corresponding change in character, as is shown in the Italian
  examples illustrated in <a href="#Fig160">160</a> <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span> and <a
  href="#Fig161">161</a>. These examples, which are reproduced from
  rubbings, exhibit the characteristic stone cut forms very clearly. A
  Gothic Uncial alphabet redrawn from a German brass is illustrated in <a
  href="#Fig162">162</a>. The group of specimens from <a
  href="#Fig154">154</a> to <a href="#Fig159">159</a> exhibit the
  chronological growth of the Uncial capitals, which were used, as has been
  said, with the various small Blackletter forms, though they were also
  used alone to form words, as is shown in <a href="#Fig160">160</a>. The
  historical progression in these Uncial examples is most interesting; and,
  allowing for the variations of national temperament, traces itself
  connectedly enough. Figures <a href="#Fig154">154</a> to <a
  href="#Fig159">159</a> are pen forms, while <a href="#Fig160">160</a> to
  <a href="#Fig163">163</a> are from stone or metal-cut letters.</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig164">164</a> to <a href="#Fig166">166</a> show
  alphabets of Gothic pen-drawn capitals that will serve as a basis for
  such adaptations as are shown in the modern examples <a
  href="#Fig152">152</a> and <a href="#Fig153">153</a>. Figures <a
  href="#Fig167">167</a> to <a href="#Fig169">169</a> show a more elaborate
  but an excellent and typical variety of this form of capital, which is
  one of the most beautiful and distinctive of Gothic letters. Shorn of its
  fussy small lines the main skeleton is eminently virile; and, though
  extremely difficult to draw, it cannot be surpassed for certain limited
  uses. Figures <a href="#Fig170">170</a> to <a href="#Fig173">173</a>
  exhibit a group of Gothic capitals more or less allied in character and
  all pen letters. Figures <a href="#Fig174">174</a> to <a
  href="#Fig176">176</a> show forms similar to those of the previous group,
  but adapted for use in various materials.</p>

  <p>Figures <a href="#Fig177">177</a> to <a href="#Fig179">179</a> show
  some English Gothic letters, the last being that employed so effectively
  in the pen-drawn page by Mr. Abbey, <a href="#Fig153">153</a>. Figures <a
  href="#Fig180">180</a> to <a href="#Fig184">184</a> illustrate various
  forms of Blackletter: <a href="#Fig180">180</a> is from a German brass,
  <a href="#Fig182">182</a> illustrates an Italian pen form, and <a
  href="#Fig183">183</a> and <a href="#Fig184">184</a> show <!-- Page 141
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span> Blackletters
  drawn by Albrecht Dürer, the latter being the simplest and strongest
  variant in this style. It is the same letter that is employed to show
  Blackletter construction in diagram <a href="#Fig144">144</a>. Figure <a
  href="#Fig185">185</a> shows the well-known and unusually beautiful
  initials designed by Dürer. Figure <a href="#Fig186">186</a> is a
  Blackletter from an English brass, although the letter forms in this
  example, as well as those of many other English brasses, may perhaps have
  been derived from Flanders, as many of the finest early Continental
  brasses were imported from the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The Italian forms of Gothic Blackletters are generally too fussy and
  finikin to be of practical value for modern use, though they often
  possess suggestive value. The letters shown in <a href="#Fig182">182</a>
  are fairly typical of the characteristic Blackletter minuscules of Italy.
  Figure <a href="#Fig187">187</a> exhibits an example of beautiful
  lettering in the Italian style, redrawn from a rubbing of an inlaid
  floor-slab in Santa Croce, Florence. The omission of capitals in long,
  confined lines is typical of many Blackletter inscriptions, as may be
  seen in <a href="#Fig149">149</a>, as well as in the plate just
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>In view of the number of fine specimens of Blackletter which have been
  handed down to us, it has been deemed <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[142]</span> unnecessary to
  reproduce many examples of its employment by modern draughtsmen. The
  pages by Mr. Goodhue, <a href="#Fig188">188</a>-9, have already been
  referred to; and figure <a href="#Fig150">150</a> shows a very consistent
  and representative use of similar letter forms by the same designer.
  Figures <a href="#Fig190">190</a> and <a href="#Fig191">191</a>
  illustrate two modern varieties of Blackletter, one very simple and the
  other very ornate. The small cuts, <a href="#Fig151">151</a> and <a
  href="#Fig152">152</a>, show excellent modern Blackletters; the first, of
  unusually narrow form, being by Herr Walter Puttner, and the second, with
  its flourished initials, by Herr Otto Hupp.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h2>ITALIC AND SCRIPT</h2>

  <p>The regrettable modern neglect of those free and very interesting
  forms of the Roman letter, Italic and Script, seem to authorize
  consideration of them in a separate chapter, even at the risk of
  appearing to give them undue importance.</p>

  <p><a name="Fig192"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/big192.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig192.png"

  <p>The first Italic type letter was derived, it is said, from the
  handwriting of Petrarch, and several admirable examples of the style,
  variously treated, have come down to us. As far as construction goes
  Italic is, theoretically, only the exact Roman form sloped, and with such
  changes as are necessitated by the sloping of the letters. Practically,
  however, it will be found that certain alterations in the outlines of the
  Roman letters must be made after giving them a slope in order to adapt
  them to their new requirements of inter-juxtaposition; and, by a reflex
  action, when words in Italic capitals are used in the same panel with
  upright Roman letters, certain variations must be made in the latter,
  such as accenting the Roman O in the same fashion as the Italic <i>O</i>
  is accented, an altered treatment of serifs, and other changes in
  detail.</p>

  <p>The Script form of letter was developed out of the running or writing
  hand, and still retains a cursive tendency in the linking together of its
  letters; although in some forms it so closely approximates to Italic as
  to be almost <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span> indistinguishable from it. Script
  lettering came into its greatest vogue during the Georgian period in
  England and at the same time in France; and was extensively employed,
  usually in conjunction with the upright Roman, in carved panels of stone
  or wood, and in engraving. The Script forms are well worthy of the
  attention of modern designers since they offer unusual opportunities for
  freedom and individuality of treatment; and because of this vitality and
  adaptility to modern uses the present chapter will be devoted largely to
  the illustration of Script examples.</p>

  <p>The old Spanish and Italian writing-books (referred to in a previous
  chapter), which in a measure took the place filled so much less
  artistically to-day by our modern school copybooks, contain many
  specimens of beautiful Script, both capitals and small letters. Figures
  <a href="#Fig193">193</a> to <a href="#Fig196">196</a> show pages from
  such books published in Spain.</p>

  <p>A simple type of Spanish capital Script letter is shown in <a
  href="#Fig201">201</a>, while a corresponding small letter, redrawn from
  a Spanish source, is illustrated in <a href="#Fig202">202</a>. It should
  be noted in the latter figure that the three lower lines are further
  removed from the ordinary writing hand and are more interesting than the
  letters in the three upper lines.</p>

  <p>The French artists and engravers were, as has been said, among the
  first to appreciate the qualities of Script, and used it in many of their
  engraved title-pages, especially during the reigns of Louis xv. and xvi.
  Figure <a href="#Fig199">199</a> shows a set of French Script capitals of
  the time of Louis <span class="scac">XV.</span>, highly flourished but
  more formal than those shown in <a href="#Fig201">201</a>.</p>

  <p>A form of Script very nearly allied to the Italic was frequently used
  for the lettering on headstones and wall tombs in the churches and
  churchyards of England. Figure <a href="#Fig203">203</a>, in which the
  lettering is taken from a tomb in Westminster Abbey, illustrates this
  style of Script.</p>

  <p>A set of Script small letters with some unusual characteristics,
  adapted by Hrachowina from the German Renaissance form shown in outline
  in <a href="#Fig192">192</a>, is exhibited as a solid letter in figure <a

  <p>Among modern American designers, Mr. Bruce Rogers has admirably
  succeeded in catching the French and Georgian spirit in his treatment of
  the Script characters; yet, nevertheless, his lettering in this style is
  still modern in feeling. In the title from a book cover, <a
  href="#Fig204">204</a>, Mr. Rogers has allowed himself just the proper
  amount of interlacement and flourishing&mdash;both of which require the
  restraint of a subtle taste or the result may prove to be over-elaborate.
  The page of lettering by the same designer, shown in <a
  href="#Fig205">205</a>, is a successful solution of a difficult problem,
  and, together with the book cover, will serve to exhibit the
  possibilities of this style of Script.</p>

  <p>Mr. George Wharton Edwards is another modern designer who has a
  penchant for the Script form. He uses one distinctive and personal style
  of it in which the larger letters are formed by two black lines separated
  by a narrow white space, as exhibited in <a href="#Fig198">198</a>.</p>

  <p>The lines from an advertisement, <a href="#Fig197">197</a>, by Mr.
  Claude Fayette Bragdon, in which Script, Italic and Roman letters are
  combined, are of especial interest from the easy manner in which the
  three different styles have been adapted to each other and made to
  harmonize in one small panel, <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span> while still preserving an appropriate
  Georgian aspect. The interlacement and flourishing, too, are handled with
  commendable restraint.</p>

  <p>Few modern artists have so successfully treated Italic capitals with
  Script freedom as Mr. Will Bradley. Sometimes employing forms of Italic
  capitals and small letters little removed from type, he will again give
  us an example of his handiwork in which Italic is used with examplary
  freedom, as is shown in the specimen from a book catalogue, <a
  href="#Fig109">109</a>. The modern trick of wide spacing often lends
  itself aptly to the swing and freedom of the swashed and flourished lines
  of Script, as may be seen in figure <a href="#Fig207">207</a>.</p>

  <p>An excellent modern Script letter, adapted from a design by Mr. Frank
  Hazenplug, is shown in <a href="#Fig206">206</a>. Its heavy face and
  originality of form make it a useful and pleasing variant.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h2>TO THE BEGINNER</h2>

  <p>The beginner in any art or craft is likely to have an undue respect
  for the mere instruments of his trade. He will eventually learn that
  tools play a much less important part in his work than he at first
  thinks; but, as it is unlikely that any sudden change in human nature
  will occur, it seems as well to devote here some consideration to the
  tools which the student will always believe to be an important part of
  his equipment. He will ultimately ascertain for himself what is best
  adapted to his own individual needs.</p>

  <p>Though every draughtsman will recommend a pen that he has discovered
  to be especially suitable for his own use, few will be found to agree.
  Perhaps it is safe to say, however, that the best all-round pen for
  lettering is the Gillot No. 303. It is not too sharp, and when broken in
  is flexible and easy. The crowquill pen will be found of little use. It
  is an advantage to have at hand a large coarse pen of little flexibility
  and smooth point for drawing heavy lines of even width. In using
  water-color in place of ink such a pen will be found more satisfactory
  than the Gillot 303, as the thinness of the fluid causes the line to
  spread whenever pressure is applied to a limber and finely pointed pen,
  with the result that the line is not only broadened, but when dry shows
  darker than was intended, as more color is deposited than in a narrow
  line. When a <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>[200]</span> narrow line of even width and sharpness
  is desired it is best to use a new pen; an older pen will, on the other
  hand, allow of more ease in swelling and broadening the line under
  pressure. A thin dry line may be obtained by turning the pen over and
  drawing with the back of the nib, although if the pen so used be worn it
  is apt to have a "burr" over the point that may prevent its working
  satisfactorily in this way. A new hard pen is likely to be the cause of a
  "niggling" line; a too limber one of a careless or undesirably broad
  line. On rare occasions, and for obtaining certain effects, a stub pen
  may be found of value, but it cannot be recommended to the beginner, as
  it is very difficult to find one that has sufficient flexibility of nib.
  Quill pens are undoubtedly useful in drawing a few types of letters (see
  some of the designs by Mr. Walter Crane shown in previous pages, for
  examples) but, not to allude to the difficulty of properly pointing a
  quill, which seems to be a well-nigh lost art nowadays, the instrument
  possesses so many annoying peculiarities that it is as well to avoid its
  use until a satisfactory command over the more dependable steel pens has
  been obtained.</p>

  <p>A pencil is, of course, a necessity in laying out the first scheme for
  lettering. The softer the pencil the more felicitous will the composition
  seem; but the beginner should guard against being too easily pleased with
  the effect thus obtained, as it is often due to the deceptive
  indefiniteness of line and pleasant gray tone. When inked-in, in
  uncompromising black against the white paper, the draughtsman is apt to
  find that his sketch has developed many an imperfection, both in
  composition and in individual letter shapes, that the vague pencil lines
  did not reveal. <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>[201]</span></p>

  <p>As to paper, Bristol-board has the best smooth surface for lettering.
  The English board is in some ways better than the American, but has the
  disadvantage of being made in smaller sheets. The difficulty with any
  smooth board is that erasures, even of pencil lines, are likely to spoil
  its surface. The rough "Strathmore" American board has a very grateful
  surface upon which the pen may be used with almost as much freedom as the
  pencil. All rough surfaces, however, while tending to promote interesting
  lines, are not suited for careful lettering, and the classic and Italian
  forms especially require to be drawn upon the smoothest possible surface.
  The American "Strathmore" board may also be obtained in smooth finish;
  and, indeed, is less injured by erasures than most Bristol-boards.</p>

  <p>The prepared India or carbon inks such as "Higgin's" or "Carter's" are
  best for the beginner; although all prepared inks have a tendency to get
  muddy if allowed to stand open, and the so-called "waterproof" inks are
  easily smudged.</p>

  <p>In devising a panel of lettering, such as a title-page for example,
  the draughtsman's first step would naturally be to sketch out the whole
  design at a very small size, say an inch and a half high, in pencil. This
  small sketch should determine, first, the general balance of the page;
  second, the inter-relations and spacings of the various lines and words
  and their relative importance and sizes. From this thumb-nail sketch the
  design should be drawn out at full size in pencil, and much more
  carefully. In this redrawing the separate letter shapes and their
  harmonious relations to each other should be determined, and such
  deviations made from the smaller sketch as seem to benefit the effect.
  <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[202]</span>
  Some draughtsmen sketch out each line of lettering separately on thin
  paper, and then, after blackening the back of this sheet, lay each line
  over the place where it is needed in the design, tracing the outlines of
  the letters with a hard point, and thus transferring them to the design
  beneath. In this way a page of lettering may be studied out line by line,
  and accurately placed or centered; but the process is tedious, and there
  is always danger of losing sight of the effect as a whole.</p>

  <p>In outlining letters which are ultimately intended to be solidly
  blacked-in, the beginner should guard against making his outlines too
  wide, especially as regards the thin lines, for the eye in judging an
  outline sketch follows the insides of the bounding lines rather than the
  outsides which will really be the <i>out</i>lines of the blacked-in
  letter, so that when finished the letter is likely to look heavier and
  more clumsy than in the sketch.</p>

  <p>When the entire pencil scheme seems satisfactory in every detail, and
  each line has been exactly determined, the whole should be carefully
  inked-in. In inking-in letters the swing of the arm should be as free and
  unobstructed as possible. For the best result it is absolutely necessary
  to work at a wide board on a solid table of convenient height and angle.
  It is impossible to letter well in a cramped or unsteady position. One
  thing cannot be too strongly urged upon the beginner. Never use a
  T-square, triangle or ruling pen in inking-in lettering. It will be found
  ultimately much easier to train hand and eye to make a straight and true
  line free-hand than to attempt to satisfactorily combine a ruled and
  free-hand line. The free-hand method is, be it acknowledged, both more
  lengthy and <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>[203]</span> difficult at first, but when the
  draughtsman does finally gain a mastery over his line he has achieved
  something which he will find of the greatest value.</p>

  <p>In a drawing to be reproduced by mechanical processes, the proportions
  of the design are, of course, unalterably determined by the required
  panel or page; but the <i>size</i> of the <i>drawing</i> may be such as
  best suits the inclination and convenience of the draughtsman. If the
  drawing is to be reduced in size (and that is the usual method, because,
  in general, it is easier to draw large rather than small), the
  draughtsman must first decide on the amount of reduction to which his
  style of rendering and the subject itself are best adapted, remembering,
  however, that a drawing is sure to suffer from excessive reduction, not
  only in general effect but in interest, for the quality of the line is
  sure in a measure to disappear. A reduction of height or width by
  one-third is the usual amount; but many of our modern designers obtain
  their best effects by making their drawings but a trifle larger than the
  required reproduction. Some even make their drawings of the same size;
  others only from a twelfth to a sixth larger. As a rule, the less the
  reduction the less the departure from the effect of the original, and the
  more certainly satisfactory the result, although more careful drawing and
  greater exactness of line are necessary.</p>

  <p><a name="Fig210"></a></p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig210.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig210.png"
      alt="210. DIAGRAM TO SHOW METHOD OF ENLARGING A PANEL" title="210. DIAGRAM TO SHOW METHOD OF ENLARGING A PANEL" /></a>
    210.
  </div>
  <p>To keep the outlines of a panel in the same proportion while enlarging
  its area for the purpose of making a drawing for reproduction, lay out
  the required <i>finished</i> size of the panel near the upper left hand
  corner of the paper, and draw a diagonal line through the upper left hand
  and lower right hand corner of this panel, extending it beyond the panel
  <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>
  boundaries. From any given point along this diagonal, lines drawn
  parallel to the side and top lines of the original panel, and extended
  till they intersect the extended left side line and top line of the
  original panel, will give an outline of the same proportions as the
  required panel. By taking various points on the diagonal, panels of any
  height or width but still of the proper proportions may be obtained (see
  diagram <a href="#Fig210">210</a>). Diagram <a href="#Fig211">211</a>
  illustrates a variation of the previous method of enlarging the
  proportions of a panel, in which, by the use of two diagonals, both
  perpendicular and horizontal center lines are retained.</p>

  <p>When it is necessary to lay out a border of a predetermined width
  within the required panel, the foregoing method can only be used to
  determine the <i>outside</i> lines of such a border, and it becomes
  necessary to make the drawing some numerical proportion, say, one-half as
  large again, or twice as large as the finished panel. The width of the
  border will then be of the same proportionate width.</p>

  <p>The beginner will find it always wise to base his lettering on
  penciled top and bottom guide lines, and occasionally to add "waist"
  guide lines, as in <a href="#Fig193">193</a>. Indeed, it is rare that
  even accomplished letterers dispense with these simple aids. These guide
  lines should invariably be laid-in with the <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>[205]</span> T-square and triangle.
  After drawing the horizontal guides, it is often advisable to run a few
  perpendicular lines up and down the paper, which will serve to guard
  against the very common likelihood of the letters acquiring a tilt. In
  drawing Italic, Script, and all sloping letters numerous sloping guide
  lines are especially necessary; see <a href="#Fig193">193</a>.
  Perpendicular guide lines will be found of marked assistance, also in
  drawing Gothic small letters, which, as they do not come against the top
  and bottom guide lines squarely, but at an angle, are often
  deceptive.</p>

  <p><a name="Fig211"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig211.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig211.png"

    211.
  </div>
  <p>If it is desirable to make two lines of lettering of the same length,
  although they contain an unequal number of letters, this may be
  effected&mdash;provided, of course, that the number of letters does not
  vary too greatly&mdash;by broadening or narrowing the letters that occur
  in one line but not in the other, and by varying the spacings about the
  <span class="scac">I</span>'s and the open letters. Note, for example,
  the spacing of the upper lines in the poster by Mr. Crane, <a
  href="#Fig87">87</a>. It is by no means essential to draw the same letter
  always exactly alike even in the same line; in fact, variation is
  generally demanded by the different surroundings and neighboring letters.
  So long as the general character of the letter remains unchanged in its
  distinctive features, such as weight, <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[206]</span> treatment of serifs,
  angles, height of waist and cross lines, etc., its width and outlines may
  be varied and arranged to help out the spacing without interfering, to
  any noticeable extent, with the uniform appearance of the line.</p>

  <p>In Roman lettering emphasis may be obtained for any special word by
  spacing its letters farther apart. This has something of the same
  emphasizing effect as the use of Italic, without so greatly breaking the
  harmony of the line. Much of the lettering of the Italian Renaissance
  shows a very subtle appreciation of this use, and in some of the most
  beautiful inscriptions the important words are often so differentiated,
  while others are emphasized by slightly larger characters.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, and within certain limits, the wider a letter the
  more legible it is likely to be. Blackness and boldness of stem alone
  will not make a letter readable. Width, boldness of hair lines and
  serifs, and a proper amount of surrounding white space are more
  essential. The Roman letter is more legible than the Blackletter mainly
  because it is black against a roomy white ground; while Blackletter, on
  the contrary, is really defined by small interrupted areas of whites upon
  a black ground.</p>

  <p>A common limitation of many draughtsmen is that they become
  accomplished in the rendering of but one style of letter, and find
  themselves obliged to use it on all occasions, whether it be suited to
  the work in hand or not, because they can command no other. In the case
  of certain designers, of course, the individuality of their work is
  strong enough to bind both lettering and design so closely together that
  they can never seem at dissonance; but, speaking generally, the adherance
  to the use of but <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>[207]</span> one type of letter can be but narrowing.
  The beginner is urged, therefore, to practice the use of many styles,
  even at the expense of gaining an immediate mastery over no one form. He
  will find himself amply repaid in the end by the increase in freedom and
  variety.</p>

  <p>While the student should possess enough knowledge of the historic
  styles and examples of lettering to prevent him from using incongruous or
  anachronous forms in the same design, historic accuracy need not prevent
  him from engrafting the characteristics of dissimilar styles upon one
  another, provided that the results prove harmonious and appropriate.</p>

  <p>Finally, the draughtsman's first aim should be to make his lettering
  readable: after this has been accomplished he should strive to give it
  beauty. Art in lettering is only to be attained by solving the problem of
  legibility in the way most pleasing to the eye. Good lettering should
  appeal both to the eye and to the mind. Only when it combines legibility
  with beauty can it be excellent.</p>

<h3>SHADES &amp; SHADOWS</h3>

<p class="cenhead">By HENRY McGOODWIN</p>

  <p>The purpose and usefulness of this book is twofold: it is intended,
  first, as a practical reference hand-book for the architect's
  office&mdash;a "dictionary," as it were, of all the shades and shadows of
  those architectural forms and details which are used in rendering
  drawings; and second, as a clear and accurate course of study in the
  methods of determining shadows, for use in schools, offices, and
  ateliers.</p>

  <p>As a text-book for draughtsmen it is the clearest and most thorough
  work that has ever been written on the subject. The study is approached
  from the standpoint and in the language of the architect rather than of
  the geometrician; and great pains have been taken to demonstrate every
  problem in the simplest terms and by the simplest methods.</p>

  <p>The book measures 9½ × 12½ inches, and is substantially bound in
  cloth.</p>
